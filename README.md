# Nikhil_Portfolio
My portfolio website I created as learning project.
Tried to learn how responsive and dynamic websites work.
Added email sending option (currently not supported as github doesn't host dynamic websites, will update when hosted dynamically)
Learned a lot of cool CSS styling options.

Well it was all part of a practical version of what I had learned in HTML CSS JS.
